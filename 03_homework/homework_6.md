**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

- data privacy(anonymization) of employee names
- impact of my model on hiring (FTE) 

After today's session, I believe ethical practices can be implemented in 2 ways at my prior work: data access, data usage.
In terms of data access, I think there were instances where I have unlimited access to non anonymized client data. The industry standard is slowly changing, where regulations are driving ethical practices and I am currently seeing this at my current workplace. For example, each column of every table is labelled with different levels of data sensitivity, tables are grouped by servers and user access controls are in place to permit individual user's access to specific servers. 
This work is driven mainly by the data management team but I can see that it is a lot of work and probably quite an investment to have the right people and the software in place to manage this.

Equitable data is a more difficult concept to grasp and I had to think harder about this to identify scenarios where I've seen this in action. 
One way equitable practice can be implemented is to have a dedicated team/function in the organization that participates in data initiatives to drive ethical practices. This is currently a practice at my current workplace as an approval process prior to the model being deployed, where models are assessed for its impact on employees and customers. 

One critique I have about this process would be that, given the time committed to developing a model, the business and data science teams would be incentivized to have the model approved and pushed into production to actualize the value expected from the model. However, the team reviewing the model is incentivized to approve ethical models and practices, while still not being a blocker for teams to create business value. I can foresee how the differences in goals may cause friction and delays between the teams. Potentially involving ethics team members earlier in the model development phase could be a better approach, where approvals are provided regarding the approach and expected impact, prior to any model development is done.
